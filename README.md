# Rearm

A simple plugin that gets (if necessary) and rewields weapons disarmed in combat.

This script is meant to be pretty transparent. Just download, install, and it will start working right away.

Note: You need to have invmon enabled for the plugin to work. Type 'invmon' to toggle that setting so that Aard indicates it is enabled.
